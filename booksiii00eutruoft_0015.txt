EUTROPIUS.

EUTROPIUS has left behind his name only and an
Epitome of Roman History in ten books. He appears
to have lived during the reigns of the Emperors
Constantine, Constantius, Julian, Jovian, and Valens,
tle. somewhere between A.D. 308 and 37 8. In the
dedication of his work to the Emperor Valens, in
whose reign it was written, he styles himself νηῆ-
clarissimus, which probably denotes that he was of
consular, senatorial, or equestri-an rank, and Maqz'ste'r
memoriae. The latter title makes him a sort of private
secretary to Valens, and possibly to one or more of
his predecessors. As such his especial duty was to
convey the decisions of the Emperor to the individuals
concerned. In ΑΙ). 363 the Emperor Julian after
making great preparations in Syria, invaded Persia
with a large army, which won many victories, but
was compelled at last to retreat. In one of these
engagements the Emperor was killed. In this army
Eutropius served, though in what capacity is not
known. He briefly alludes to it in Bk. x. 16,
