meaning of the Latin words should be known both in
the context and also separately, and it is for this
reason that many teaehcrs make their boys write
down the words when they have looked thern out,
and so form their own vocabulary. But young boys
do not copy faithfully, and if the words have been
learnt off from these home-made vocabularies, a large
crop of errors will have been stored up. The winnow-
ing process is not an easy one.

These considerations have decided the Editors to
adopt the plan of arranging the vocabularies in the
order of the text. The boys can here learn the voca—
bulary to a lesson after the construing has been made
clear to them, and thus get to know the words both
in the context and independently of it. If the master
always gives part of the time to an examination in
” the back vocabularies‚ the knowledge of his pupils
will increase rapidly.

Should it be found that the learning of so many
words is apt to produce a confused rather than a
clear knowledge, the master can make his boys mark
the important words only to be learnt, the rest being
considered in the context alone. In this way some of
the root words of the language will become familiar,
and the beginner’s memory may escape the danger of
the confusion which comes of trying to remember too
