xii EUTROPI BREVIARII I. ET 11.

Julianus iussmtzss apparatu Parthis intulit bellum, cui
arpeditione esso quoqne inlmsui. It is very probable that
he was the Eutropius mentioned by Ammianus Mar-
cellinus, a historian who wrote about twenty years
later ; if so, he was proconsul of Asia, was accused of
sedition, and acquitted.

His work commences with the foundation of Rome
by Romulus, and ends with the death of Jovian,
A.D. 363. He is almost entirely free from the faults
of other writers of his age. His style is simple,
restrained‚ and easy: his Latin much better than
that of most of his contemporaries: he appears to
have used Livy, Dio Cassius, and Suetonius as his
authorities: as a historiari his judgment is cool and
impartial, as a writer he is free from errors of bad

ι taste.
